Stay organized, focused, and in charge. Tackle anything from small projects to large initiatives. You may or may not be a project manager, but now you can be the boss of any project with a powerful, easy-to-use app. If you're a Project Online subscriber, you can work with your projects in a more agile way in the Project Online Desktop Client. If you are used to using Kanban for Scrum methodologies to manage your projects, the Project Online Desktop Client allows you to create and manage your projects in a familiar way through the use of task board views of your projects and the ability to create sprints-based projects.
