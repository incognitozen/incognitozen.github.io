Producteev is a free task management application for individuals and teams to collaborate via the web, email, IM, mobile or desktop.

<em><strong>Reason For dead</strong></em>

Producteev, part of the Jive portfolio, has been a valuable task management solution for small and medium sized teams. With Aurea’s acquisition of Jive, we are focused on our go-forward vision: Jive as the gateway to companies’ people and knowledge. After careful consideration, we have made the decision to discontinue Producteev as of June 18, 2018, and it will no longer be available for use.
