Sales pipeline software that gets you organized. Helps you focus on the right deals, so easy to use that salespeople just love it. Great for small teams. Pipedrive is full of features that help you prioritize deals, track performance and predict revenue

Pipedrive set out to build a customer relationship management (CRM) tool that helps users visualize their <a href="https://hackerspad.net/classification/sales/">sales processes</a> and get more done. They knew from experience that in sales, as in life, you can’t control your results – but you can control your actions. So, they created Pipedrive around activity-based selling, a proven approach that’s all about scheduling, completing and tracking activities.

The second bit of sales wisdom they built into Pipedrive are visual pipelines. They’re as easy as putting sticky notes on a whiteboard to see where each of your deals stands, except with way more smart features (and they won’t blow away in a breeze).
