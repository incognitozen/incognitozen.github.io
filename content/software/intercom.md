Intercom is a customer relationship management and messaging tool for web businesses. Build relationships with users to create loyal customers. Intercom helps you build customer relationships through conversational, messenger-based experiences across the customer journey. Every customer interaction is an opportunity to build a relationship, and earn a lifelong fan. Adopting a conversational, messenger-based approach helps each connection feel friendly, personal, and convenient — creating happy, loyal customers.

Intercom offers three core packages of features: <em><strong>Lead generation, Customer engagement, and Customer support</strong></em> (formerly known as Acquire, Engage, and Support). Each of them includes different combinations of tools tailored for the corresponding purpose. For instance, the ‘Customer support’ kit includes Business Messenger and Team Inbox combined with Help Center Articles, Answer Bot, and Customer Data.
