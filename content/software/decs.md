With DECS, you can store, secure and tightly control access to private snippets, tokens, configurations, certificates, and other sensitive data all in one workspace. Your data is encrypted and decrypted on your device automatically. Nobody, not even we can read it!

We all crawl the web in search of code. How many times have we painfully repeated steps to land on that same piece of code again? With DECS browser extension, using single-click, capture the code snippets on the go and store them for future use. Say goodbye to scattered code snippets.

DECS is more than a searchable coding diary. Tag, share and sync your curated snippet knowledge base with in a Team, Organisation <i data-v-94f2d674="">(coming soon)</i> or with the World. Import and export your code snippets seamlessly with no platform lockdowns. Truly own your data.
