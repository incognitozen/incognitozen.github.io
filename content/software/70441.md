PasswordBox gets passwords off your mind. Say goodbye to multiple usernames and passwords. Your PasswordBox master password is the only one you'll ever need! The True Key app protects your passwords by scrambling them with AES-256, one of the strongest encryption algorithms available. Only you can decrypt and access your information with the factors you choose. Sign-in is simple; Just type in your master password on the device you trust. When not on a Trusted Device (a friend's phone, hotel computer), you'll be verified by a second authentication factor for safety. Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is standard with the True Key app. You'll always be verified by at least two factors before being signed in. Customize your profile by adding more factors — the more you add, the safer your profile becomes. McAfee respects your privacy. Your passwords belong only to you — accessible only by you. We never share or sell your data.
