Adalo is a no-code platform for building powerful web and mobile apps, that can include payments, notifications, and more. Publish to the App Store, Google Play and the web. Creating web and mobile apps today requires learning how to code, finding a technical cofounder, or raising a lot of capital. For some, this means spending lots of precious time and money before they can get their idea off the ground. For others, this cost is simply too high and they walk away from their dream.
