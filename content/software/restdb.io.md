restdb.io lets you create databases and REST APIs quickly. Development databases are free. Powerful web-based and mobile-friendly data management.

restdb.io is probably the easiest online NoSQL database backend for web and serverless "low code" applications. Model your information quickly. The data management application, schema and REST API are instantly available using our powerful API Automation technology.

In the backend, users collaborate and work with data in multiple ways. A centralized search let's users quickly search through the entire database quickly (if given access). It's also a breeze to navigate the database relationships.

The online database tool is designed for the modern web with high performance automated REST API and NoSQL MongoDB query language, <i>low code</i> server-side javascript codehooks, user authentication (Auth0), Media Archive, Realtime messages and secure Ajax/CORS. The development database plan is completely free for up to 3 users.

restdb.io NoSQL databases can also serve web pages. Use HTML, Javascript, jQuery, Angular, ReactJS (or your favorite framework) on restdb.io Pages with server-side data-binding. Add your own secure domains for the web pages and the REST API.
