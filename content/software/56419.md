Airtable works like a spreadsheet but gives you the power of a database to organise anything.

Airtable can store information in a spreadsheet that’s visually appealing and easy-to-use, but it’s also powerful enough to act as a database that businesses can use for customer-relationship management (CRM), task management, project planning, and tracking inventory. One of the biggest advantages of using Airtable is that it’s very intuitive to use and creates beautiful and functional databases while also offering additional powerful customisation features.

For example, Airtable can be used by:
<ul>
 	<li>Creative teams &amp; agencies</li>
 	<li>Project management teams</li>
 	<li>Marketing &amp; communications teams</li>
 	<li>Product management teams</li>
 	<li>Or just individuals!</li>
</ul>
