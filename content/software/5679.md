An innovative Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) protects your computer from malware and doesn't require frequent updates.

Windows meets the requirements of C2-level security of the U.S. Department of Defense, it already has all the necessary mechanisms to provide access control. ReHIPS takes advantage of these built-in mechanisms and operates in a restrictive manner (if it is not explicitly allowed, block it). It executes every restricted application in the isolated environment (ReHIPS mode) with its own set of rights. Even if this application is compromised, your operating system stays protected and secure.
