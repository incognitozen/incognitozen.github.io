Asset Forge allows anyone to create 3D models and 2D sprites using building blocks.

You'll have access to a large library of pre-made blocks (over <strong>700</strong> currently), they're each categorized in different sections. You can place an unlimited number of blocks in your creation after which it's possible to export and use in the game engine of your choice.
<ul>
 	<li>Position, rotate, mirror and resize blocks</li>
 	<li>Export to common 3D file formats (see below)</li>
 	<li>Render your model as a 2D sprite</li>
 	<li>Apply colors, materials and textures</li>
 	<li>Batch export a sprite in multiple directions</li>
</ul>
The exported models are compatible with most game engines including Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender and ThreeJS. The 2D sprites (PNG) are compatible with all game engines that support sprites.
