Originally founded as a project to simplify sharing code, GitHub has grown into an application used by over a million people to store over two million code repositories, making GitHub the largest code host in the world. GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over 24 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 67 million repositories. With the collaborative features of GitHub.com and GitHub Business, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code.

Github was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in stock. The deal, which heightened Microsoft’s focus on open-source development, aimed to increase enterprise use of GitHub and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences.
