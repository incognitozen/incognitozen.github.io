Master Password avoids all the pitfalls: a cryptographic algorithm calculates your site's password for you, only when you need it.
When you're done, it erases the password from the device, so it can't be stolen. Master Password's unique approach makes you safer from loss, theft, problems with backups, sync, confiscation, snooping, and more.
